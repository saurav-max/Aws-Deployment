Caching Topics-
There is a three types of caching 
1 Server side
2 CDN
3 Client Side

CDN---

A CDN  is a network of distributed servers strategically placed across different geographical locations.

Its Primary purpose is to deliver content Such as images , videos, Script, Stylesheet and other static assest to users with high performance and availability.

When a  user request content from a website the CDN serves that content from the nearest edge server to the users Location reducing latency and load times 

CDN cache static content like images, videos, css and javascript files, storing them on their servers for fast retrieval 

CDN also offer features like DDoS protection security enhancement and scalability for handling spikes in traffic.


Server Side Caching------

Server side caching involves storing dynamically generated content (HTML pages, pages, database query results, API responses, etc).in a cache on the server.

The purpose is to reduce the load on the server by serving cached content to subsequent requests instead of generating the content from scrath.

Server-side caching is typically implemented using technologies like in memory caching eg Redis and Memacached,  databse query caching or HTTP caching headers.

Unlike CDNs, Which focus on static content server side caching is more flexible and can do both static and dynamically content  generated by the server.

Server side caching can be customized based on specific application requirement and can improve the overall performance and sclability of web applications.

--------------------------------------

While  CDNs primarily focus on delivering static content quickly to users by caching it on edge servers located around the world, server-side caching is more versatile and involves caching dynamically generated content on the server to improve performance and reduce server load Both techniques can be used together to enhance the performance scalability and reliability of web applications.


Client side Caching--

Client-side caching involves storing resources, such as HTML files, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, and other assets, in the user's browser cache. This caching mechanism helps reduce server load, decrease page load times, and improve overall website performance by allowing browsers to reuse locally stored copies of resources instead of fetching them from the server on subsequent visits or page reloads.
