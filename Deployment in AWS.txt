Deployment in AWS:


To deploy a Spring Boot application on AWS, you'll use several Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure your application runs smoothly, is secure, and can handle production traffic. Here's a list of the key AWS services involved in this process:

1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Purpose: Virtual servers to host your Spring Boot application.
Usage: Create and manage instances to deploy your application.

2. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Purpose: Storage service for hosting files.
Usage: (Optional) Store application assets, backups, or deployment artifacts.

3. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
Purpose: Managed relational database service.
Usage: Host your application's database, like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

4. Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Purpose: Isolated network to run your AWS resources.
Usage: Define network configurations, subnets, and security groups for your instances.

5. Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management)
Purpose: Manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
Usage: Create roles and permissions for your application and users.

6. Amazon CloudWatch
Purpose: Monitoring and logging service.
Usage: Monitor your application, set up alarms, and track logs.

7. Amazon Route 53
Purpose: Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
Usage: Route traffic to your application and manage domain names.

8. Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)
Purpose: Manage SSL/TLS certificates.
Usage: Secure your application with HTTPS.

9. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
Purpose: Automatically distribute incoming application traffic.
Usage: Improve availability and fault tolerance of your application.

10. Amazon CloudFormation
Purpose: Infrastructure as code service.
Usage: Define and provision infrastructure resources using code templates (Optional).

Deployment Process with AWS Services

1. Setting Up EC2 Instance
Service: Amazon EC2
Steps:
Launch an EC2 instance with the required AMI.
Configure security groups to allow necessary traffic (SSH, HTTP/HTTPS).

2. Connecting and Configuring the Instance
Service: Amazon VPC, Amazon IAM
Steps:
SSH into the instance using the provided key pair.
Install Java and other necessary software on the instance.

3. Deploying the Application
Service: Amazon S3 (Optional)
Steps:
Transfer the Spring Boot JAR file to the EC2 instance.
Run the Spring Boot application using the Java command.

4. Database Configuration
Service: Amazon RDS
Steps:
Set up an RDS instance with the desired database engine.
Configure your Spring Boot application to connect to the RDS database.

5. Monitoring and Logging
Service: Amazon CloudWatch
Steps:
Set up CloudWatch to monitor your application logs and performance metrics.
Configure alarms to alert you of any issues.

6. Domain and SSL Configuration
Service: Amazon Route 53, Amazon Certificate Manager, Elastic Load Balancing
Steps:

Use Route 53 to point your domain to your EC2 instance.
Obtain an SSL certificate from ACM and configure it with ELB.
Set up an ELB to distribute traffic and provide HTTPS support.

Summary of AWS Services for Spring Boot Application
Amazon EC2: Host the application.
Amazon S3: (Optional) Store assets or deployment artifacts.
Amazon RDS: Manage the application database.
Amazon VPC: Configure network settings.
Amazon IAM: Manage access and permissions.
Amazon CloudWatch: Monitor application performance and logs.
Amazon Route 53: Manage domain names and DNS settings.
Amazon Certificate Manager: Obtain and manage SSL certificates.
Elastic Load Balancing: Distribute traffic and provide high availability.
Using these services ensures that your Spring Boot application is deployed in a scalable, secure, and highly available environment.
