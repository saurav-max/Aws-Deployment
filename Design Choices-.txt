Design Choices-

JSON Web Encryption is a standard for exchanging encrypted data using JSON and Base64 . JWE allows you to encrypt a JWT payload so that only the intended recipient can read it. JWE also payload so that only the intended recient can read it. JWE also provides integrity and authentication checks.

JWE-JWE is not supported by all languages by all languages and frameworks.

JWT-JWE   cannot be invalidated intentionally without storing the token in a databses or cache store defeating the purpose of using JWT in the first place.

Workaround would involve shortening expiry time which would increase the load on the database e verytime one needs to refreash the token 

large payloads in scenarios of storing additional details like access control role id etc via JWT-JWE WOULD INCREASE REQUEST size which is not ideal for mobile devices with limited bandwidth.
